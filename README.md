Practice and Challenge Assignment for Module 9

## Background
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Overview
The purpose of this data analysis is to determine if the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu demonstrates the feasibility of running a surf and ice cream shop business year-round. With the data, W. Avy and I will decide whether our surf and ice cream shop business could be open for business year-round or if we should decide to temporarily shut down during low periods of the year. 

## Results
![June Temperatures](https://github.com/Itgotworse26/surfs_up/blob/main/June_Temps.PNG)

* The average temperature in June was 74.94 degrees. 
* The coldest it got in June was 64 degrees.
* The warmest it got in June was 85 degrees.


![December Temperatures](https://github.com/Itgotworse26/surfs_up/blob/main/December_Temps.PNG)

* The average temperature in December was 71.04 degrees. 
* The coldest it got in December was 56 degrees.
* The warmest it got in December was 83 degrees.

## Summary
In order to find some additional data, I ran two queries to find out the measurements for the levels of precipitation in June and December.

![June Rainfall](https://github.com/Itgotworse26/surfs_up/blob/main/June_Rainfall.PNG)

* The average precipitation in June was 0.136 inches. 
* The lowest level of precipitation in June was 0 inches.
* The highest level of precipitation in June was 4.43 inches.


![December Rainfall](https://github.com/Itgotworse26/surfs_up/blob/main/December_Rainfall.PNG)

* The average precipitation in December was 0.217 inches. 
* The lowest level of precipitation in December was 0 inches.
* The highest level of precipitation in December was 6.42 inches.


With the current data on hand, the small gap in temperatures and precipitation seem to justify running the surf and ice cream shop year-round. Average tempratures, lowest temperatures, and highest temperatures between June and December were fairly similar, and while it rained more in December, the differences in average rainfall was only 0.081 inches and the differences in highest rainfall was only 1.99 inches. 

While data on who would be the comsumer base might help W.Avy and I determine the course of our business more accurately, the current climate data suggests that operating year-round is justified. I would push for looking into figuring out if we want to market our business to different consumer bases during different periods of the year; say marketing to tourists in high-seasons and locals in low-seasons, but this sort of consumer data was not available to us. However, the lack of this two data query does not detract from the fact that the climate data suggests that year-round operation is feasible.
