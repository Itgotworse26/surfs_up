# surfs_up
Practice and Challenge Assignment for Module 9

## Background
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Overview
The purpose of this data analysis is to determine if the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu demonstrates the feasibility of running a surf and ice cream shop business year-round. With the data, W. Avy and I will decide whether our surf and ice cream shop business could be open for business year-round or if we should decide to temporarily shut down during low periods of the year.
